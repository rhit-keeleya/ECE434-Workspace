Various project related files stored here. Not sure quite yet what it is gonna look like...


Ideas:

Store pics/videos in tmp, serve them on webserver - send URL to owner on motion detect.

Allow user to "save" media -> transfer out of tmp. 

Periodically check storage used... if almost full, purge oldest tmp files to free up room?
